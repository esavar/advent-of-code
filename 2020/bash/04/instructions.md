Count the number of valid passports - those that have all required fields. Treat cid as optional. In your batch file, how many passports are valid?

Your puzzle answer was 206.

### Part Two

You ignore the cid field, but each other field has strict rules about what values are valid for automatic validation:

*byr (Birth Year)* - four digits; at least 1920 and at most 2002.  
*iyr (Issue Year)* - four digits; at least 2010 and at most 2020.   
*eyr (Expiration Year)* - four digits; at least 2020 and at most 2030.  
*hgt (Height)* - a number followed by either cm or in:  
If cm, the number must be at least 150 and at most 193.  
If in, the number must be at least 59 and at most 76.  
*hcl (Hair Color)* - a # followed by exactly six characters 0-9 or a-f.  
*ecl (Eye Color)* - exactly one of: amb blu brn gry grn hzl oth.  
*pid (Passport ID)* - a nine-digit number, including leading zeroes.  
*cid (Country ID)* - ignored, missing or not.  

Your job is to count the passports where all required fields are both present and valid according to the above rules.

Your puzzle answer was 123.
